# The Gist

This repo is an exploration of the different state solutions in a React app.
The solutions are portrayed in descending order of preference within `src/App`.

This order of preference was come to by:

1. Aiming for the simplest pattern to solve the problem at hand (lowest cyclomatic complexity)
2. Aiming for as few technologies and libraries as possible (lowest bar to entry for developers)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
